Brain Tumor Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can classify brain tumor images into two categories - benign and malignant. The model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of neural network that can automatically learn useful features from images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Brain Tumor Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 253 MRI images of brain tumors, with 98 benign and 155 malignant cases. Each image is 512 x 512 pixels in size.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.8
TensorFlow 2.0
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this project consists of several layers:

Conv2D layer: This layer performs the convolution operation on the input image. It applies a set of filters to the image, which helps to extract useful features.

MaxPooling2D layer: This layer performs the max pooling operation on the output of the previous layer. It reduces the size of the output and helps to extract the most important features.

Flatten layer: This layer converts the output of the previous layer into a one-dimensional feature vector.

Dense layer: This layer is a fully connected layer that performs a linear operation on the input features. It applies a set of weights to the input features and generates a set of output features.

Dropout layer: This layer randomly drops out a fraction of the input features during training. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.

Training and Testing
The dataset is split into training and validation sets using the ImageDataGenerator class in Keras. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

The model is trained using the fit method in Keras, with a batch size of 256 and a total of 10 epochs.

Results
After training the model, it achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test data set. This shows that the model is able to effectively classify brain tumor images into benign and malignant categories.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks for brain tumor classification. The model achieves good accuracy on the dataset and can potentially be used in real-world applications for brain tumor diagnosis.
